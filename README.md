This project explores the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist using PostgreSQL.  
The goal is to build a relational database and run analytical queries to extract insights about sales, customers, sellers, and logistics.

## Dataset Source

- Kaggle: [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

## Database Setup

1. **Create Database**
   - Database Name: `Olist_Project`

2. **Tables Created**
   - `customers`
   - `geolocation`
   - `order_items`
   - `order_payments`
   - `order_reviews`
   - `orders`
   - `product_category_name_translation`
   - `products`
   - `sellers`

3. **Data Import**
   - Use `COPY` or import tool of your SQL client to upload data from CSVs into the corresponding tables.
